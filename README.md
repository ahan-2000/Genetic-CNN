# Genetic Algorithm for Transfer Learning in a deep CNN
## Abstract
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are extremely effective for image
recognition tasks, and they have become popular in recent years. Most state-of-theart CNN architectures are designed manually with domain expertise. Designing the
architecture for a CNN is a cumbersome task because of the numerous parameters
to configure, including activation functions, layer types and hyperparameters.
Current CNN architectures complex and require a lot of time to train on large
image data sets. Transfer Learning and Fine-tuning can reduce the training time
significantly, but they require a lot of manual experimentation to find the best
architecture.
This assignment aims to state a method which utilizes a Genetic Algorithm to find
the best architecture for Transfer Learning and fine-tuning without much manual
intervention. A group of hyperparameters is constructed (chromosome) and these
are again grouped to form a population. This population goes through a Genetic
Algorithm and after a few generations, the algorithm will properly find better
hyperparameters for the CNN.
